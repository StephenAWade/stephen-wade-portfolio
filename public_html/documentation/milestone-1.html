            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>The main purpose of my Personal website is to provide a platform on which I can showcase my work as
                    a creative professional in order to bolster online interaction with my name and work, attract potential patrons
                    and admirers who are as of yet unfamiliar with my work, and to connect with interested parties who wish to contact me.</p>
            <h2>Audience</h2>

                        <li>Interested Fine Arts Professionals: Other members of the fine arts community who may wish to apprehend what others are doing in their field.</li>

        <h1>Persona</h1>
            <h2>Name</h2>
                <p>Samantha Klein (50 years old)</p>
            <h2>Profession</h2>
                <p>Samantha is an editor for a regional fine arts magazine based in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>
        <h1>Technologies, Behaviors/Attitudes, and Goals</h1>
            <h2>Technologies</h2>
                <p>Samantha uses a 13-inch, 1.6 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 Macbook Pro with the macOSS Monterey Version 12.2.1. She uses Google Chrome. She is a power user who works in a
                    fast-paced literary environment in which she is required to read pieces from her devices, provide edits, and submit them back to their authors for changes.
                    She also uses her devices to interact with agents and to locate and interact with unrepresented talent. She has an iPhone 13 on which she sends SMS texts
                    and emails (also using it for a hot spot in the even that she does not have access to wireless internet), and an iPad mini on which she reads pieces during
                    travel (or as a break from her computer).</p>
            <h2>Behaviors/Attitudes</h2>
                <p>Samantha is an Ivy League grad with an interest in publishing western writers and painters. She is accustomed to pressure, tight deadlines, and has a high work capacity.
                    She wants writing to grab her from the very first page and expects the same from websitesâ€”they must be styled according to basic design principles, being simple,
                    elegant, and easy to maneuver. She is primarily interested in the content, but recognizes that the presentation of that content says much about the writer she is investigating
                    and can effect judgment of a piece on the webpage. </p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>Samantha wants to find unread talents who can infiltrate and thrive in the notoriously insular world of literary fiction.</p>
            <h1>Role and Scenario</h1>
                <h2>User Story</h2>
                    <p>Samantha: As a power user I want to be able to find authors who fit the ethos of our publication and publish them to shift copies.</p>
                <h2>Use Case</h2>
                    <p>A friend of mine has recently read a short piece by Stephen Wade and has encouraged me to learn more about him online, as he may be someone I would
                        consider publishing. I google his name and find he has a portfolio of his work online showcasing who he is as a creative.</p>
