<h2>Content Strategy:</h2>
<h3>Fullscreen Welcome Banner (with Before/After Slider)</h3>
<p>A fullscreen banner which showcases my name, with titles of the major topics with which I concern myself surrounding
    my name (i.e. Music, Composition, Writing, Fiction, Educator, Performer, etc.) and placed in
    such a way so as to appear to be at various distances (parallax) ahead and/or behind my name, giving the banner a 3D
    effect. This banner will have a list of links which will redirect the user to corresponding portions
    of the webpage if selected on the top right-hand side. The background will be of two pictures which will have a
    "before/after slider" bisecting them. The picture eon the left will be of a concert hall, whereas the picture on the
    right will be of a writing desk and/or books, and the user will be able to move the slider horizontally to epose
    more of one picture and less of the other, ending at the border of the section to fully expose one picture while
    fully cover the other (this can be done for either picture (i.e. moving the slider all the way to the left
    exposes fully the right picture and moving the slider all the way to the right exposes fully the left
    picture).</p>
<h3>Background for the "Fullscreen Welcome Banner"-"Contact" Sections:</h3>
<p>This background (colored in dark purple in the wireframe) will pervade behind the section boxes of About Me, Music
    Compositions, Music Performance, Creative Writing, and Contact. It will be of two pictures (a concert hall and a
    writing studio), in a fixed position, which will meet in the middle at the center of the Music Performance Section
    (i.e. half way). The meeting points of these two pictures will be a faded black background, thus obscuring the seam
    at the point of the video box so as not to distract from the content of the video. This means the first photo
    (the concert hall) will fade into black against its bottom border, whereas the second picture (a writing studio)
    will fade from black starting at its top border. This will make it appear the two pictures are fading into each
    other, separated by a dark section on which the Music Performance video window can rest without visual
    competition. Each photo will have its own separate division (one div for the top background photo and another div
    for the bottom background photo.</p>
<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>This section will detail my skills as a writer, composer, and musical performer, and will outline my history working
    in those fields. This section will appear as a box set within the background described above. The background of this
    section will be a solid dark color contrasting well with the picture background set behind it. The contents of this
    box will be an "About" Header towards the top, p tags with description of skills and experience to the right side,
    and a picture of myself centered and appearing on the left side, with space underneath the "About" header separating
    the two.</p>
<h3>Music Compositions:</h3>
<p>This section will be of a box within/on top of the top background photo division with the same or similar dimensions
    to the "About Me" section. This box will be separated into thirds, with written content on the left-hand side taking
    up 1/3 of the available space and sheet music documents taking up the latter 2/3rds. It will feature a header on the
    left-hand side titled "Music Compositions" with paragraph tags with a brief explanation of my composition
    style/background/desires/etc. On the right there will be a row of stacked compositions the user may select for
    viewing. When the user hovers over one of the pieces it will slide out slightly; when a user selects a composition,
    the document will slide out to the middle of the page/and or may open in a larger rectangular pop-up window. I may
    try to incorporate recordings to accompany the sheet music when it is selected if there is time, but this is a goal
    over and above my basic desires for this project. All documents will be made with iFrame.</p>
<h3>Music Performance:</h3>
<p>This section will have no accompanying plain color box (as was the case with the "About Me" and "Music Compositions"
    sections. As mentioned above, the background divisions will meet in the center of this section, fading to black as
    they do so. In front of this faded black will be a video player where the viewer will be able to watch a video of a
    musical performance. Directly above this will be a header with the title of "Music Performance" which will exist in
    front of the meeting background photos. </p>
<h3>Creative Writing:</h3>
<p>This section will be of a box within/on top of the bottom background photo division with the same or similar
    dimensions to the "About Me" and "Music Compositions" sections. It will have exactly the same layout as the "Musical
    Composition" section, with header and paragraph tags to the left, and content to the right, the header and paragraph
    taking up roughly 1/3rd of the available space with the creative writing pieces taking up the remaining 2/3rds of
    the available space. Creative Writing pieces will be displayed in a carousel which user can flip through manually by
    hovering over adjacent pieces. I will also, if there is time, attempt to put in an automatic element which will flip
    through items automatically given the passage of a given period of time. All documents will be made with iFrame.</p>
<h3>Contact:</h3>
<p>This section will be a box within/on top of the bottom background photo division with slightly larger dimensions of
    previous like sections. This is where interested parties will be able to contact me via a form if they are
    interested
    in pursuing a connection. This section will be split in half and will feature a header titled "Contact" with
    subheaders with my phone and email information on the left and a contact form (first name, last name, email, and
    message, with a submission button at the bottom of the form which will send the message to my email once clicked.</p>
<h3>Footer:</h3>
<p>This section will cover the whole span of the browser window and will mark the end of my page. It will be of a
    uniform color and writing in it specifying the year of the website's creation and an author/designer attribution
    (i.e. "Created by Stephen Wade"). The top boarder of this section will serve to mark the end of the bottom
    background photo division.</p>
